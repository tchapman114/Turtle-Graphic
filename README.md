# Turtle-Graphic
Having fun with Python's libraies! Created a small graphic by imporing the time and turtle libray. 
Program will first draw out an apple tree, then a turtle will climb up the tree and eat all the apples.
Once the turtle is full, it climbs back down and display a message for the users.
